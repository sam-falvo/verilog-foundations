This queue implementation was first realized in my
Keyboard Interface Adapter (KIA)
core, first used with the Kestrel-2 homebrew computer design.

I later extracted it and made it more generic,
suitable for use in a homebrew Spacewire receiver project.
However, it is still a bit too application-specific.

This core attempts to refine it once more into something which is easier to parameterize and reuse regardless of project.
